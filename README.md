# Superhero hunter
#### Tech stack: HTML, CSS & JS. 
- [API](https://superheroapi.com//) - Super-Hero-Hunter

##### In this superhero hunter project , I have added following features:
-- This project has three different pages and every page has different features:

###### Home page
- Search any superhero from the API and it will display the search results on the frontend (as I type the search results should update, just like Google does for suggestions).
- Each search result of the superhero  have a favourite button, clicking on which the superhero will be added to “My favourite superheroes” (a list).
- On clicking any particular search result (any superhero), open a new page with more information about that superhero (Superhero page).
###### Superhero Page
- This page will show a lot of information about the superhero like their name, photo, powerstats, bio .

###### My favourite superheroes Page
- It will list of all the favourite superheroes. and each superheros have remove from favourites button, 
clicking on which will remove that superhero from the list.
